@MTTM-fc5ol: Genre 😊. I haven't come across this meaning before and pronounction is really very mysterious. Great to know both.

@CAlM876: Thanks , Lucy from the heart ❤
@uraniatsagkataki5712: 3-6-9-10! 👎🏻

TZATZIKI:
Tz = J for Jack, jacket 
        Not ts 

METEOROLOGIST 
Instead of yr proposal
I will keep the Greek
pronunciation, since
the word is greek. 
(Aristotelous, Meteorologika!).

Thank you Lucy! 
🌹🌹🌹👍🏻🇬🇷
@girlybteam1566: I got 13 correct ones out of 15
I didn't know how to say (infamous) and (indict)
@tammytsang3487: I got two mistakes. ❤😊Thank you!
@ilonapawliszyn9246: 4/15 😅
@TawfiqSadat: Thanks alot dear teacher
@Karim12karim636: Thank you Lucy, I always follow your videos I find a lot of information about English.
@user-np2ln1qo8q: I love to take all of your programms course but, I am broken Lucy
@user-no2mz9hl4f: “Silvia is an entrepreneur who started *her* own tech company.”  Their is a pleural pronoun; Silvia is a singular person.  Therefore, “her” is the correct pronoun to refer to Silvia.
@michaelmerin740: 13/15 (pronounced genre the French way ['zhaner] and mispronounced iota altogether)
@ratanasorn8080: 12:44 Thanks to Florence Pugh, I know to pronounce this word 😂
@RabiousCrow: Ontopronaur in Spanish 😀
@Santiago_Falco: So... Would it be data or data?
@user-no4ij8lx6w: حلم 💭 حلم 💭 حلم 💭 حلم 💭 حلم 💭 حلم 💭
@theoneandonlykk86: Great video, but I wish you wouldn't use words that require extensive knowledge of specific fields. I'm quite sure the vast majority of people have never heard of "tzatziki", for example, unless they're chefs or really passionate foodies. Just a suggestion though, not criticism, I do love your videos. 🙂
@0788809349: Got 5 of 15 😂😂
@yonathanmeza6931: Hello Lucy🎉
@brendanmarchal: In my opinion, the (12) "Iota" should be prononced as it is. It's a latin word (coming from the greek) [yota or eeota] so you should prononce it good like you do for "Alpha" "Omega" etc...
@kloassie: I only had the 6th (indict) wrong. The rest a bit different pronunciation here and there but nothing seriously incorrect
@cintalopez-teijeiro5683: You saying: I struggle with this word" It is so comforting. This was super fun. Spanish follower here 😅
@saidakhalikovawellenglish2543: 12 of 15 were correct
@brendanmarchal: Entrepreneur is a french word comes from Entreprise (compagny), Entreprendre (start, build a business) 
The ('EN' french sound doesnt exist in English, so English language took the closest sound 'ON')
@skpince: 12. not bad at all.
@CP-wn9ck: I was able to pronounce 12 words correctly
@agborreuben8473: Omg I pronounced just two correctly
@JannHofmann: 13:47 Hopefully they store rolled up banknotes on my property... I would open squirrel farms everywhere all over the globe ...😅
@user-wq5kn4cz2v: Welcome 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😮
@bienveillance57: Many Thanks Lucy from eastern France... 12 good pronunciations !
@vieuxdiallo5998: Lucy I'm really keen on your teaching methode especial the pronounciation section
@MariannaD934: 9/15 
Not bad but I thought I could do better with this!
@RoelWerkman: The Chaos - Gerard Nolst Trenité :) and Ghoti
@davidseale8252: I'm a 75 yr old Englishman and was expecting to get them all right. I got two wrong. One was a foreign food which I've never eaten but the other was Entrepreneur ! I have always pronounced it as Au - trepeneur so many thanks for clearing that up for me.
@oliviaa.bugnon5018: 13/15 :)
@KristianKumpula: 12:47 That one surprised me because I thought that /ts/ sounds in the beginning of a syllable aren't used in the English language. I wonder why the T in "tsunami" is silent then
@anupbanerjee688: I got 12 out of 15 and I love your videos my accent is improve much.Thank you Lucy❤
@gaelanubis: 7/15 😅
@SweDennis: 14/15 for me ... failed the quinoa one, as exemplified in the clip, otherwise smooth sailing. 😀
@vnshngpnt: Surprisingly I knew all except indict 😅
@shivangirana: I got 4 correct. Thanks for the wonderful lesson, Lucy. Love from India.
@peshalajanendra8382: 10/15 😊
@joelsonmaoying4712: I Loved It.❤❤❤
@Hyunskay1307: For the word entrepreneur, I got it the first time because in French it is pronounced in the same way 😂❤
@zekibilen1775: Thanks Teacher ❤
@alfonsver2058: I didn't know every word, but pronounced Most of 'em correctly. Score: 14/15
Number 6 caught in the wrong foot.
@subhadeepbatabyal7846: It feels great to watch ur vdo.. Thank u Mam.. From 🇮🇳
@Merike7173: Indict was wrongly pronounced by me.😊
@CollinFeatherston: I always mispronounce entrepreneur!
@mdnayonsarker1838: I am watching from Bangladesh ❤
@michaelburton3594: I got just 13....Cheers ya Lusy!!!
@user-eq2dx2jp6v: ❤❤❤❤❤❤ hiiiiiii dear teacher ❤❤❤❤
@sudhanshumohanty3478: The word "genre" is derived from French. It's pronounced with gen as a nasal word & r is hardly audible
@philipcmchan: Thank you for the lesson.  I like to pronounce English words in modern RP.  Would you introduce how to pronounce the word “tsunami”?  It should be a Japanese word.  Should we pronounce it like Japanese pronunciation “tsu-na-mi” or as some English speakers pronounce as “sun-a-mi”?
@Adam_mohammed_: 14 🎉😂
@Beatlefan67: I have to admit I didn't know the Greek work but I did pronounce it correctly.   (I'm a native English speaker from Dorset, so any 'R's' tend to get an 'extra roll'!)  I love regional dialects and accents and practice them regularly.  Bristol is a favourite at the moment ('Awl-rite me babber?' say that with a West Country twang)
@SpecialGuestStar: 13/15, indict is a word I haven't used before, and quinoa is I haven't even heard before.
Lucy, I'd like to point out that the timestamps have different words.
@addictedtoguitars4948: 15/15

@maximvolodkin6809: got 13.5 👌thank you, Lucy!
@isalutfi: Hi Lucy. Thank you for these amazing lessons! Keep it up!
@rashidnawaz3869: Great to know ☺️
@danvasii9884: You should make a list with similar, but different sounding words, like: sheep- ship, laughed-loft, sick-seek, ankle-uncle.... so people not speaking English to get the gist of it....
@Dreamer_121: Great exercise👍 I actually didnt know the pronunciation mostly words here🤣🤣 But... i'v got a really flexible tongue🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣✋...and good hearing, i guess.
@danvasii9884: Chinese have a problem with ”r” sound and replace it with ”l”... blewely...sounds like a Welsh term.....
@RTBOSS: I can say but i don't know how to say that's the problem very less words knowledge:(
@cherishemmanuel6603: Thank you so much Lucy, I just learnt how to pronounce indict, laughed, tzatziki, environnementalism, quinoa, genre, infamous, indubitably...

My British accent has become much better over the years. Thank you❤
@kevinfox7660: I got 10 right.
@christianmiller.MathTeacher: ok, 13/15, but i hear most of these on CNN.

feb you uh ree
@nedludd7622: Like you, I pronounce "quinoa" as "ki-No-a". That word has changed over time. For "indict", a few months ago a representative in Congress made a fool of herself by demanding the "in-dick-ment" of a political opponent. Of course she is Republican. TV comedians had a field day with that one.
@user-ck5rh4ky6u: Got 13 out of 15. I've never heard of tzatziki, and I know what iota means, but in my native language we pronounce it differently, so that threw me off. 
However, I'd say that pronouncing single words isn't that difficult for me, rather when I speak for an extended amount of time sometimes my tongue just starts to malfunction, so I can mispronounce some of the simplest words. 
I'm fluent in Spanish as well and their pronunciation is way easier (at least Latin American Spanish), never happened to me to be physically tired of speaking it, but English tires my speech apparatus even after quite a few years of practicing it daily.
@kwtamim3211: you know Lucy I have seen your all video I really love to learn from you,,,,, ❤
I really like you I know you have husband 😁
@angelcontreras1781: I thank you pretty, for your gorgeous pronunciation. Greetings from Canada.

*P.S. Happy Birthday to you!💖💖💖 Better late than never!*
@Gianmaria_: The word "indubitably" killed me. :)  So 14 out of 15 for me. Thank you Lucy!
@user-kf5sv4bn6g: 12 out of 15😊
@danielcubides5170: As a Colombian and I'm sure many Spanish native speakers agree with me, English pronunciation turns everybody insane since most of our words have the stress placed on the last syllable (in written Spanish you'd see it with this punctuation sign é above the hardest sounding letter, Americans may have seen it on words as résumé) often leaving us accentuating the final syllable without noticing English is perhaps one of the most diverse languages on Earth when it comes to diction lmao
@shafeequllahsatari2094: I was mispronouncing words like 'quinoa' prior to subscribing to your channel, but this time I got 15/15 correct pronunciations. Thank you for such helpful videos. ❤
@user-vu2jc4oj3p: You really amazed me with these hard-to-pronounce words as per usual. Thank you,  Lucy
@vladimirb5319: Quite often I have a relatively good idea of how a word should be pronounced, but I simply cannot get the proper sound out of my throat ... but this was useful and interesting ...
@weiareinboud6990: 4 wrong. Indict and iota (I pronounced it the Greek way), infamous wrong stress,  metereological with met like get...
